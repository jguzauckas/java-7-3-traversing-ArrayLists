# Basics Check

In `Check.java`, do the following:
- Create an `ArrayList` that stores `Person` objects.
- Store five historical figures in the `ArrayList` (use the age they died at as their `age`).
- Use a regular `for` loop to increase every `Person` object's `age` by `1`.
- Use a regular `for` loop to find and remove one of your historical figures based on their `name`.
- Use a `for-each` loop to print out each `Person` in the `ArrayList`.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
