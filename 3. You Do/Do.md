# You Do

In `Do.java`, do the following:
- Create an `Integer` `ArrayList` and use a loop to add the even numbers from `2` to `100` to it.
- Use a regular `for` loop to remove the elements who are divisible by `3` (are multiples of `3`).
- Use a `for-each` loop to print out the remaining numbers.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
